Hello, my name is Janice Leung. I am currently a senior studying computer science at the University of Southern California.

### Objective
At the moment, I am seeking a **Full Time** job after I graduate in May 2015. I hope to be working daily to solve interesting and challenging problems. I have an interest in _Data and Information Retrieval_ as well as _computer security_.

I am also looking for a **spring 2015 internship/co-op** at a Southern California based startup. 

### Interests and Goals
I am interested in broaden my experiences in all aspects and grow as a full stack developer. I always look for opportunities to expand my experiences in coding and try to develop on a variety of different platforms. Please feel free to contact me if you think I would be appropriate for a project. Thank you.
