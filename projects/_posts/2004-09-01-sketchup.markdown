Whilst in Highschool, I had a lot of interest in drawing things in 3D. Google Sketchup was amazing in allowing me to draw a wide variety of items. Although not all the drawings were successful, the 3D warehouse hosts some of the models I drew. 

After drawing the models in Google Sketchup, I occasionally also used the KerkyThea renderer to try and paint the models as realistic as possible. Despite never reaching full realism, I tried to portray lighting, reflecting and shadows as well as possible. 

I have included links to both the 3D warehouse and also my picase album of some of my renders.
