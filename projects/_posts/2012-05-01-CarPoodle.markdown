Started at the Los Angeles CleanWeb Hackathon, as a team of four, we are creating a web application for event organizers to easily manage car pooling for events. We aim to be able to let organizers see clearly how drivers and riders are grouped together with minimal amounts of input and management from users. We hope that CarPoodle will be a useful tool for various types of organizations, from school to professional groups, to allow them to organize car pooling for their events in an effortless manner.
