Ardio is a online music player, powered by apis provided by rdioÂ®, that aims to be accessible. It was created during a weekend long hackathon sponsored by Project Possibility. I was part of a team of five, and I contributed mainly to the layout of the website - making sure the site was functional and user friendly, but also accessible.

My first ever hackathon!
