For the SS12: Code for a Cause hackathon, we created an application that alerts a person with hearing impairments of auditory disturbances, such as sirens or smoke alarms in 36 hours. The project description was: While the application is running it listens via the phone's microphone(s); identifies audio disturbances such as sirens, smoke alarms, car horns, and crying children; and notifies the user of the cause of the disturbance with visual and haptic response. 

In the 36 hours, we were able to create an iPhone application that flashes red when a firetruck or fire alarm rings. For the next step, we are aiming to identify the source of alert, and have the application analyse frequency even when the application is not in the foreground.
