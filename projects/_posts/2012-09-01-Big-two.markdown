For a class project, I created the Big Two Card game following the rules and variations stated [here](http://www.pagat.com/climbing/bigtwo.html). Three different versions of the game was created: the first version was purely graphical using JFrames and painting graphics and ImageIcons; the second version used JPanels, and Java Swing objects to create a GUI version of the Big Two Game, adding even more functionalities such as saving, loading player information and creating players; In the final version of the game, I added an AI computer player.
