During High School, I was part of the School film club. Through film, I helped filmed and edit many school productions and events. I also helped teachers with their video related teaching materials. Furthermore, I helped create video adverts for the English School Foundation Film Festival in Hong Kong. As part of my coursework in film, I created various short films. In the summer before starting at USC, I helped create advertisements for a new personal fitness and training center in Hong Kong.
