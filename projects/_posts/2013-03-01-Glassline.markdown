A 4 person group project where we were given a graphical user interface and have to create the appropriate APIs, to make the user interface link together properly. The glassline consists of three parts, the sensors, announcing when the piece of glass enters or leaves your conveyor segment, the conveyor, which moves the piece of glass along your conveyor, and the popups, which moves the piece of glass up and down to the machines. Thie project encourages us to create APIs based off an agent design system, allowing things to be loosely coupled.
