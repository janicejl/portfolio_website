The best way to learn a language is by practicing. Words for Kids aims to create a platform for learning a language through audio and visual cues. Teachers can use the camera to create flash cards of words they want their students to learn. They can also record audio for the student to hear. Students will then be able to click through the words and attempt to type the answer. If they need a hint, they can click on the picture to hear the teacher speak. Students can then earn points for getting the answer correct. By making students listen and type, they can practice both the listening and writing part of learning a language. 

This project was created during the 24 hour AT&T Mobile App Hackathon. We worked as a group of 2. Through this project, I focused more on working on the layout of the application, and also setting up the local SQLite database for the application.
