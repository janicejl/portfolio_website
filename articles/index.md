Following my interest in the computer industry and technology, I used to write for <a href="http://www.plomonet.com/blog/" target="_blank">Plomonet.com</a>, a tech enthusiast's block, as a full time editor. Through the articles, I try to give an account of the technology as well as reviews.

Below is a list of articles, linking to Plomonet. I hope you enjoy them.
