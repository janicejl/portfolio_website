            <span class="text10">This project started over a 24 hour hackathon held by LinkedIn for Interns. Interns of all companies were welcomed. I teamed up with 2 other LinkedIn Interns to create a Inventory Management system to replace the rather inefficient system used currently by LinkedIn. Through the hackathon, we were able to create all the features needed to replace the current system. Most importantly, LIIM is able to maintain an accurate inventory count, which was not always possible with the old system. After getting feedback from the users of the system, we have incorporated a lot of their suggestions. </span>

            <span class="text10">The best way to learn a language is by practicing. Words for Kids aims to create a platform for learning a language through audio and visual cues. Teachers can use the camera to create flash cards of words they want their students to learn. They can also record audio for the student to hear. Students will then be able to click through the words and attempt to type the answer. If they need a hint, they can click on the picture to hear the teacher speak. Students can then earn points for getting the answer correct. By making students listen and type, they can practice both the listening and writing part of learning a language.</span>

            <span class="text10">Started with a friend, we are working to create a system for USC students to be able to easily make a four year plan of their courses. This will allow them to easily create and keep an electronic copy of the plan they will give their advisor, and also allow them to plan and see if they have space to make more interest classes, or pick up a double major or minor. 
                <br />
                <br />
            The current catelogue system is archaic and cumbersome to navigate -- as it is simply a direct copy of the printed paper copy of the catalogue. We hope to make it a lot easier to browse the catelogue and create four year plans.

This included creating the animations that will be triggered when the agents call the appropriate doXXX() APIs. We also had to create panels, such as the factory control panel or parts creation panel, to control how many and what kinds of kits are created, as well as the items that make up a kit. We also had panels to control the non-normative scenarios of the factory, such as the lanes being jammed, or the grippers failing.  </span>

            <span class="text10">Whilst in Highschool, I had a lot of interest in drawing things in 3D. Google Sketchup was amazing in allowing me to draw a wide variety of items. Although not all the drawings were successful, the 3D warehouse hosts some of the models I drew.
            <br />
            <br />
            After drawing the models in Google Sketchup, I occasionally also used the KerkyThea renderer to try and paint the models as realistic as possible. Despite never reaching full realism, I tried to portray lighting, reflecting and shadows as well as possible. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I have included links to both the 3D warehouse and also my picase album of some of my renders. </span>

I also helped teachers with their video related teaching materials. Furthermore, I helped create video adverts for the English School Foundation Film Festival in Hong Kong. As part of my coursework in film, I created various short films. In the summer before starting at USC, I helped create advertisements for a new personal fitness and training center in Hong Kong. </span>
